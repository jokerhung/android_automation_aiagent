// Windows Job Object that owns the Node child + its descendants.
//
// Without this, killing the launcher (Servy stop, Task Manager, MSI uninstall)
// can leave the Node grandchild + its node-pty descendants resident. v0.1.21
// shipped with that bug visible as: orphaned node.exe after service uninstall,
// and `pty.node` MSI-renamed to `C:\Config.Msi\<id>.rbf` because the running
// Node process still held the .node loaded.
//
// Pattern: a single process-wide unnamed Job Object with
// JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE. The launcher holds the only handle for
// its full lifetime — when the launcher process exits (graceful or killed),
// the OS closes the last handle, the job destructs, and Windows terminates
// every process in the job (Node + node-pty + scrcpy.exe etc.). Job
// membership is inherited by default, so children spawned by Node also land
// in the job automatically.
//
// Failure modes are swallowed (return Err to the caller, which logs and
// continues). Reasons:
//   - launcher itself in a parent job that doesn't allow nesting (rare on
//     modern Windows but possible under some MDM / debugger configurations)
//   - ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED on OpenProcess if the child somehow lost privileges
// In any of these cases we want the launcher to keep running with v0.1.21
// behavior (graceful degradation) rather than refuse to start.
//
// v0.1.23-beta.9 update — graceful-exit release:
// The kill-on-close behavior is exactly right for ABNORMAL termination
// (Servy stop, Task Manager kill, launcher crash) — those bypass our
// cleanup path and the kernel's job-tear-down is the safety net.
//
// But for GRACEFUL exit, kill-on-close is too eager. Velopack's in-app
// updater spawns Update.exe as a grandchild (launcher → node → Update.exe)
// to perform the package swap AFTER the parent process exits. Since job
// membership inherits, Update.exe lands in our job. When Node exits cleanly
// after applyUpdate(), the supervisor exits, main() exits, our last job
// handle closes, and the kernel TerminateProcess's Update.exe mid-extract
// — leaving the install in a half-state and requiring a manual relaunch
// to complete the upgrade.
//
// Fix: `release()` clears the KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE flag on the existing job
// before main() returns. Job still gets destroyed when the launcher exits,
// but its remaining members (notably Update.exe) survive. Hard-kill paths
// don't run our cleanup, so the v0.1.21 safety net stays intact for them.
// Diagnosed v0.1.23-beta.7→beta.8 apply flow via Velopack log cutting off
// mid-line at "Extracting 393 app files" — classic TerminateProcess
// signature.
