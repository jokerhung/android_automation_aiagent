// §32 Part 5 — launcher-served "updating, please wait…" page during the
// in-app upgrade window.
//
// (Phase 1 rearchitecture renamed this subsystem `upgrade-server` →
// `operation-server` to reflect its broader role; the legacy
// `--upgrade-server` CLI flag is kept as a read-time alias for ~2 release
// cycles so existing post-stop.bat files keep working.)
//
// Background: §32 Part 4 (the cmd.exe + bat post-stop architecture) closed
// the service-restart race so that the new Node binds the port reliably
// within ~15s of clicking Apply. But during that ~15s window, browsers
// that try to load the URL (refresh, new tab, fresh navigation) hit "port
// connection refused" and the OS renders its "this site can't be reached"
// page. v0.1.25-beta.18 → beta.19 smoke confirmed this gap: the in-page
// ServerReachabilityOverlay handled the "user is watching the loaded
// page" case poorly (browser auto-navigated away on graceful socket
// close before the overlay's 10s detection window fired). Part 5 fills
// the gap with a small server-side mechanism instead of a browser-side
// one — user explicitly rejected Service Workers as fragile.
//
// Architecture:
//   1. Post-stop bat spawns `<launcher> --operation-server` AFTER Node
//      exits but BEFORE `sc start`. The bat fire-and-forget-spawns, then
//      continues to its `timeout` + `sc start` sequence.
//   2. Operation-server reads the web port from config.json, binds it,
//      serves a static "updating" HTML page on all paths (200 for root,
//      503 for /api/*). HTML page has inline JS that polls /api/config
//      every 1s, reloads the page when real app responds with 200 JSON.
//   3. Operation-server self-exits on either:
//      - <dataRoot>/control/operation-server-stop marker present (the new
//        supervised launcher writes this before spawning Node) — legacy
//        `upgrade-server-stop` marker also honored at read time.
//      - 30 seconds elapsed (safety cap; if Node isn't up by then, the
//        user is hitting a deeper problem the upgrade page can't paper
//        over)
//   4. Each TCP connection handled in its own short-lived thread.
//      Connection count during a typical upgrade is single-digit;
//      no need for async.
//
// Subcommand argv: `<launcher> --operation-server` (canonical;
// `--upgrade-server` accepted as legacy alias)
//   - No positional args (port resolved from config.json)
//   - Self-exits cleanly; no shutdown handshake required from caller
//
// Exit codes:
//   0 — clean exit (stop marker observed OR max lifetime elapsed)
//   3 — bind failed (port in use; usually means we lost the race to new Node)
//   4 — config.json read failed
//   5 — could not resolve data_root
