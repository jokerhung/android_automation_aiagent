/**
 * Best-effort cross-platform "open this URL in the user's default browser."
 *
 * Used by the v0.1.9 first-run UX: when the LOCAL user instance starts
 * for the very first time (firstRunComplete=false, installMode is not
 * service-mode), we invoke this so the user lands on the welcome modal
 * without having to remember to type the URL into a browser themselves.
 *
 * Detached + ignored stdio so the Node server doesn't wait on the
 * browser process. Any failure is logged at info level — opening a
 * browser is a UX nicety, not a hard requirement.
 *
 * Implementation per-platform:
 *   - Windows: `start "" "<url>"` via cmd.exe /c. The empty quoted
 *     title is required because cmd's `start` interprets the first
 *     quoted token as a window title; without it, the URL would be
 *     misparsed.
 *   - Linux:   `xdg-open <url>`. Standard freedesktop.org launcher.
 *   - macOS:   `open <url>`. (Reserved; we don't ship macOS today.)
