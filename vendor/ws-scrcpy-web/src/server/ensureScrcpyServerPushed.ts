/**
 * Push scrcpy-server.jar to the device only when the remote copy is missing
 * or has a different size.
 *
 * Why this matters: Android runs dexopt on a JAR's first load to precompile
 * classes into an .odex alongside the jar. Repeated loads of the same file
 * skip dexopt — a 15-20s speedup on older devices like SM-T550. But an `adb
 * push` of a freshly-rebuilt file changes its mtime/content and invalidates
 * the dex cache. Keeping the remote copy in place between sessions preserves
 * the warm cache.
 *
 * We gate on size (via `wc -c`) rather than a hash to keep the check cheap.
 * If ws-scrcpy-web is rebuilt with a newer scrcpy-server binary, the size
 * changes, we push — which is what we want.
