/**
 * HTTP API for SP3 P4a graceful shutdown.
 *
 *   POST /api/server/shutdown -> 200 { ok: true }
 *
 * Used by the Windows tray helper and the Settings "stop server & exit" button
 * (§27) to request a clean process exit without killing the Node process from
 * the outside (which would skip flush hooks).
 *
 * Contract (per docs/plans/sp3-p4a-contracts.md):
 *   - Body-less request; payload is ignored.
 *   - Response is sent first, then teardown + `process.exit(0)` are scheduled
 *     via setTimeout so the response gets flushed to the socket before the
 *     event loop shuts down.
 *   - 100 ms is empirically enough on localhost; the tray helper's
 *     ureq POST has its own 5 s timeout and exits regardless of reply.
 *   - On the scheduled tick we run `cleanup()` (the shared gracefulShutdown
 *     from index.ts — stops the adb daemon + releases running services) and
 *     await it BEFORE exiting, so a button/tray quit doesn't orphan the adb
 *     daemon. process.exit(0) is a clean exit; the launcher's supervisor sees
 *     `decide_restart(0, false) == None` and does NOT restart (exit 75 is the
 *     restart sentinel — deliberately NOT used here).
 *   - No auth: localhost-only intent. Future hardening if exposed remotely.
