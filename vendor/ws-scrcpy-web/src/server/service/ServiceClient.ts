/**
 * Cross-platform service-manager abstraction for SP3 P3 (Service Mode).
 *
 * Backed by:
 *   - ServyClient   — Windows real implementation using Servy v8.2 CLI
 *   - SystemdClient — Linux stub (every method throws); full impl arrives later in SP3
 *
 * Factory: `getServiceClient()` (see ./index.ts) selects the right client for
 * the host platform and surfaces an `unsupportedReason` for non-win32 hosts so
 * the API + UI can render a graceful "service mode unsupported" state.
 *
 * The interface stays minimal: install / uninstall / status / restart / stop.
 * Each call is keyed by the canonical service name (`WsScrcpyWeb`); install
 * also takes display name, description, binary path, start type, environment
 * vars, the log path, and (on Linux) a scope selector.
 *
 * Account model: Windows always runs as Local System (Servy default); Linux
 * uses systemd's user-vs-system scope. There is no `account` field — the
 * 0.1.4 ServyClient bug came from passing `--account` to a Servy 8.2 CLI
 * that doesn't accept that flag, so the surface is now scoped to what each
 * platform actually consumes.
