/**
 * Reads the actual installed scrcpy-server version from the on-disk
 * marker at <deps>/scrcpy-server/.version, falling back to the bundled
 * SERVER_VERSION constant when the marker is absent or empty.
 *
 * The marker is written by DependencyManager.installScrcpyServer after
 * a successful updater download. Pre-marker installs (legacy seed
 * promotions) do not have a marker; for those, SERVER_VERSION is the
 * accurate value because the seed binary is bundled at build time and
 * always matches the constant.
 *
 * Used by:
 *  - DependencyDefinitions.scrcpy-server.checkInstalled — for the UI's
 *    "Installed" column. Pre-fix this returned SERVER_VERSION
 *    unconditionally, causing the post-update "Update available" loop
 *    when the on-disk binary was actually newer.
 *  - DeviceProbe / ScrcpyConnection — as the version arg to
 *    `app_process / com.genymobile.scrcpy.Server <version> ...`.
 *    scrcpy validates this against the JAR; passing a stale constant
 *    against an updated JAR causes silent connection failures.
