 * change to keep the discriminated union exhaustive.
 *
 * Variant semantics:
 * - `unsupported`: service mode not supported on this platform.
 * - `uac-declined`: user clicked No on the Windows UAC prompt
 *   (PowerShell Start-Process -Verb RunAs exited with ERROR_CANCELLED 1223).
 * - `handoff-timeout`: the service-context handoff couldn't reach a
 *   user-session launcher within the discover() timeout, OR (post-v0.1.25)
 *   the LocalSystem direct-uninstall path was deliberately not attempted
 *   because UAC can't fire from session 0.
 * - `handoff-no-target`: active session resolution failed AND no fallback
 *   path is available. Reserved; not currently emitted but type-stable for
 *   future granularity.
 * - `invalid-token`: the X-Resume-Token header was missing or didn't match
 *   a recently-issued token for the requested action.
 * - `servy-failure`: servy-cli (or systemd-side equivalent) exited non-zero
 *   on the actual install/uninstall operation.
 * - `service-start-failed`: the unit installed without error but never reached
 *   the running state (e.g. a bad ExecStart). The failed unit is rolled back
 *   and the app stays in local mode — the caller should surface a retry.
 * - `unknown`: catch-all for legacy / uncategorized failure paths.
